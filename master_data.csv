“Located on the north end of San Francisco and encompassing Fisherman’s Wharf, Telegraph Hill, and Embarcadero, North Beach is a large neighborhood on the bay with diverse neighborhoods and plenty to do. Some of San Francisco’s most iconic landmarks are located here, including Pioneer Park, Coit Tower, Pier 39, and Washington Square. Considered one of the nation’s best neighborhoods, North Beach started out as an actual beach and was filled in during the late 1800s.
During the 1950s, North Beach was a meeting place for the Beat Generation, a literary movement that included several famous authors like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Learn more about this important movement at the Beat Museum, located off Broadway. North Beach is hilly, and several famous staircases are located throughout. Climb to the top of the Peter Macciarini Steps for terrific views of the Financial District, the Vallejo Stairs for beautiful bay views, or the garden-filled Filbert Street Stairs.
Like all of San Francisco, you won’t be lacking great restaurants or nightlife when you move to North Beach. Some neighborhood favorites include Tony’s Pizza Napoletana, Caffe Trieste, Sotto Mare, Mama’s on Washington Square, and Hillstone.”

Hello!
The Room:
On offer is a beautiful, large room in a prime location within the mission. The room is roughly 10' wide and 9' long. The room currently accommodates two dressers, a desk, a California king bed, a chair, a jewelry armoire, and a nightstand. The room has a closet in the room and one across the hallway with some additional storage space as well. The bay windows face south and receive some direct sun throughout the day. The house has hardwood floors and gets lots of light throughout. The dining room and living room are open and spacious.
House Layout:
The house is the top two stories of a duplex. This room is located on the first floor, where the kitchen, dining space, and living room are all located. There are two other rooms on this floor and a total of two bathrooms on this level. Upstairs there are three more rooms and three more roommates, who all share one bathroom, although we are all free to use whichever bathroom is closest to us when the need arises.
The house contains a total of six roommates (including this room). The kitchen is large and we never have issues sharing space as everyone has their own schedule. There are two large fridges that are each shared three ways and you will have your own dedicated shelf in the fridge. There is dedicated space in the pantry as well for each roommate.
Amenities:
The apartment has in unit washer and dryer. The landlord is very responsive when called upon and I haven't had a better landlord in the 10+ years I've lived in SF. The apartment has a back patio / backyard space that is shared with the downstairs neighbors. The downstairs neighbors are incredibly warm. They have two young children and are always friendly with conversation and communication. There is a cleaner that comes twice a month to clean common spaces. There is a garage with a space you might be able to rent for an additional cost. That will need to be worked out with the landlord.
The Vibe:
The roommates are all open to new folks bringing their own furniture, decorations for common space, and ideas for changing things up. The vibe with the roommates is very laid back and we all care about each other, pitching in to help each other out when necessary and respecting each other. We enjoy laughing together and talking about life openly. We are all very busy and have our own social lives but still enjoy the occasional impromptu dinner or activity together. Anyone would be lucky to live with this awesome group of individuals. This would be a good fit for anyone that wants a house with built-in warmth. We are all busy and keep our own schedule but moments when we overlap at home are filled with conversation and joy.
Utilities:
Average around $100/month per person.
Move in:
I am flexible on move in dates. I can be gone at any date and can work to accommodate your schedule. If you're interested you'll need to fill out this questionnaire. If the link isn't working, just reply to this ad and we'll send it over so you can tell us about yourself. From there, we will schedule a meet & greet with the roommates so you can feel each other out :). Can't wait to meet you!

285 Turk St. is planned to be converted into a Limited Equity Housing Cooperative (LEHC). LEHCs offer several significant benefits of ownership as opposed to rental: stable and secure housing from which tenant owners cannot be evicted; savings from accruing a modest amount of equity in the unit (1-2% per year); and an inheritable right to the unit which the shares represent, which can be passed on to your successors just like regular homeownership.
Apply today and you could become a homeowner in the near future!

Literally less than a stone's throw away from an N-Judah Metro stop and two blocks away from Golden Gate Park, this bottom level In-Law has been freshly painted and is in move-in condition. It has recently refinished and resealed bamboo flooring throughout except in the bathroom. Upgraded kitchen appliances include air fryer oven and new microwave, granite countertops with under-mounted stainless sink. No dishwasher. A new key-optional electronic door lock with separate deadbolt in entry. Bathroom with updated plumbing fixtures boasts a walk-in shower stall. Electric heating in the kitchen area complimented with new supplemental electric heater in the bedroom. Access to an exclusive portion of the backyard via patio doors with insect netting. Includes sole use of a 5’x7’ locked storage area.
Tenant pays for garbage and electricity (individual meter) while water is included. There is no current laundry on site, so for those unclear: no washer / no dryer, but a laundry service is a block away. Easy street parking follows street cleaning regulations with no need for permits.
* No smoking/vaping of tobacco, pot, or drugs otherwise
* No dogs or strange critters, including no fishtanks due to bamboo flooring. A cat may be considered on a case by case basis with refundable pet deposit.

Remodeled Victoria mini-loft in the Emeric-Goodman Building, an official
City landmark. Studios with sleeping lofts. Geary @ Van Ness.
College students with parent co-signers ok.
Available mid-November.
Listed on the National Register of Historic Places. National Register #75000473.
San Francisco Landmark #71: This building was constructed by Joseph Emeric from France as his residence. It remained in his family until 1899 when his granddaughter sold it to Abraham and Sarah Goodman from New York. The Goodmans ran a tailoring business on the ground floor and lived above the store. After surviving the Great Earthquake and Fire, the building was extensively repaired and modernized. The building was completely renovated again between 1983-1985 preserving all the historical details, including the Victorian façade and birdcage elevator....
The renovation received a citation for architectural conservation from Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage . Janis Joplin had lived in a small room on the second floor in the early sixties, as had Wes Wilson, who created the first Psychedelic posters for the musical events at the Avalon-Family Dog and Fillmore-Bill Graham....
Hi-tech intercom with video....
New hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, granite counters. Birdcage elevator. Large windows. Laundry in building. Roof deck.
Non-smoking building....
Close to Civic Center, Japantown, Van Ness movie theaters, major churches
and best bus (Geary/O'Farrell 38). Garage parking available nearby @ about $300/mo.",2025-12-03 00:47:33,124571.64,3286,2599

San Francisco Landmark #71: This building was constructed by Joseph Emeric from France as his residence. It remained in his family until 1899 when his granddaughter sold it to Abraham and Sarah Goodman from New York. The Goodmans ran a tailoring business on the ground floor and lived above the store. After surviving the Great Earthquake and Fire, the building was extensively repaired and modernized. The building was completely renovated again between 1983-1985 preserving all the historical details, including the Victorian façade and birdcage elevator.
The renovation received a citation for architectural conservation from Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage . Janis Joplin had lived in a small room on the second floor in the early sixties, as had Wes Wilson, who created the first Psychedelic posters for the Family Dog and Bill Graham.

San Francisco Landmark #71: This building was constructed by Joseph Emeric from France as his residence. It remained in his family until 1899 when his granddaughter sold it to Abraham and Sarah Goodman from New York. The Goodmans ran a tailoring business on the ground floor and lived above the store. After surviving the Great Earthquake and Fire, the building was extensively repaired and modernized. The building was completely renovated again between 1983-1985 preserving all the historical details, including the Victorian façade and birdcage elevator.
The renovation received a citation for architectural conservation from Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage . Janis Joplin had lived in a small room on the second floor in the early sixties, as had Wes Wilson, who created the first Psychedelic posters for the musical events at the Avalon-Family Dog and Fillmore-Bill Graham.
Hi-tech intercom with video.

staircase to sleeping loft with floor to ceiling bookcases and closets on
2 levels. The sleeping loft is the bedroom and is not high enough to stand

Non-smoking building.

San Francisco Landmark #71: This building was constructed by Joseph Emeric from France as his residence. It remained in his family until 1899 when his granddaughter sold it to Abraham and Sarah Goodman from New York. The Goodmans ran a tailoring business on the ground floor and lived above the store. After surviving the Great Earthquake and Fire, the building was extensively repaired and modernized. The building was completely renovated again between 1983-1985 preserving all the historical details, including the Victorian façade and birdcage elevator.
The renovation received a citation for architectural conservation from Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage . Janis Joplin  lived in the building in the  early sixties, as did Wes Wilson, who created the first Psychedelic posters for the musical events at the Avalon-Family Dog and Fillmore-Bill Graham venues.

The building was completely renovated again between 1983-1985 preserving all the historical details, including the Victorian façade and birdcage elevator.
The renovation received a citation for architectural conservation from Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage .

This 600ft apartment is one of six units.  The building is on a large private lot and is 130 feet away from the street and perched at the top of a hill overlooking the valley below.  You see unobstructed views from every double paned window.   Stunning views of the Bay, San Bruno Mountains, and the valley below make you feel like you are on vacation.   And those mountain trails are just 20 minutes away!  The property is well maintained and owned by the original builder's family.  He sold the land surrounding the building many years ago and kept this portion for this building because it has beautiful views that are unobstructed. It would have made a great VRBO if not for city restrictions.  Come see for yourself.
The apartment features
- a nice spacious layout
- 1 bedroom / 1 bathroom
- renovated kitchen with new quartz countertops and all new appliances
- complete new bathroom with quartz shower walls,  rain shower head, new everything.
- hardwood flooring throughout
- On-site laundry room with private storage closets
- Secluded 130' private driveway for a quiet setting
- Optional covered parking available ($200/month)
This is truly a lovely place.   Take a look before you make up your mind on where you pick to live.

Originally known as the Langerman's Tobacco and Segar Warehouse built in the 1850's, the Belli Building is more famously known as the Law Offices of Melvin Belli.  It is said that after successfully litigating notorious personal injury cases for celebrities such as Chuck Berry, Muhammad Ali, and the Rolling Stones, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his office building and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory.
Today, this San Francisco Landmark has been fully restored and renovated to offer  modern and comfortable living.  The new ""Landmark 9"" residences offer spacious living areas, high end appliances, and luxury finishes within a secured building.
This Jackson Square Location offers endless neighborhood options for great dining, watering holes, and coffee shops.

Spacious 1BD with Remodeled Kitchen and Lots of Natural Light in Inner Richmond
156 9th Avenue - 101, San Francisco, CA, 94118
$3495 per month
Available November 25th
1 bed, 1 full bath
797 sq. ft.
Deposit $3495.0
THE APARTMENT:
This spacious unit offers a warm and inviting atmosphere with hardwood flooring throughout the living areas and a sleek, tiled bathroom. Large windows fill the space with abundant natural light and provide excellent ventilation, creating a bright and airy environment. The kitchen is equipped with rich dark-wood cabinetry and crisp white appliances—including a dishwasher—making meal prep and cleanup both stylish and convenient. Perfect for comfortable living in a well-appointed home.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD: THE INNER RICHMOND
The Inner Richmond offers a great compromise of the urban and suburban -- it has both the energy of pedestrians, shops, cafes, and Irish bars as well as quiet nights, a low crime rate, and plenty of good schools. And then there’s the Presidio to the north and Golden Gate Park to the south. Inner Richmond borders the half of the park with the most things to see and do (other than nature): the Conservatory of Flowers, de Young Museum, the California Academy of Sciences, the Japanese Tea Garden, and the Botanical Gardens. Like any neighborhood in the western part of the city, though, be prepared for wind and fog, but also a relatively lower cost of living.

Beautiful Remodeled View 1-Bedroom with In-Unit Laundry
Property Address
760 North Point St. | 204 | San Francisco, CA 94109
Available: 12/13/2025
Offered By
RDM Apartments
Description
This is a very nice one bedroom unit near the corner of North Point and Hyde streets. It is extremely well appointed and has all the modern conveniences you would want in a nice apartment. The building contains 14 apartments and most of the building has been remodeled to a very high quality level.
The unit is on the third floor on the north side of the building, which means it is away from the street and very quiet. It has a very nice partial view towards the east bay. It has been completely remodeled. It has all new double paned windows with screens and real wood blinds.
The kitchen of the unit includes maple laminate cabinets, granite counters and near new appliances. There is a high quality gas range, built in microwave, dishwasher, disposal, fridge and freezer. Most importantly, it has a brand new in-unit laundry!
The bathroom has a very nice checkerboard design of white and black tile. The plumbing in the building is all rebuilt, including copper pipes, new waste lines, etc. The hot water is instant because there is a re-circulating system with an electric pump which keeps the hot water flowing through insulated pipes. The faucets and shower valves are modern and almost new. There is a large mirror and large medicine cabinet. The bathroom is ventilated by an automatic re-circulating fan system on the roof to help keep the bathroom fresh and mildew free.
The unit has lots of recently upgraded lighting. All of the wiring in the unit is new. There are many electric plugs.
The building as a whole has been very substantially remodeled. We completely restored both the courtyard and the back of the building last year. It looks great. There's also a Swiftlane intercom system for access along with a double gated entry for security.
The unit has a hardwood floor. It is fully insulated (walls, ceiling, floor), so it is warm in the winter and cool in the summer. All of the walls are new sheet rock, with new wood trim throughout as well. The hardware is from Baldwin Brass and is top notch.
Utilities are not included. They run about $250-$300/mo for water, trash, sewer, internet, and PG&E.
Anyway, if you would like to see the unit, give me a call the number listed in the ad or email me. I am the owner and manager – you don’t have to request repairs through a management company. I take care of my tenants. And because the building is largely new, there are few problems anyway. Thanks for your interest.
Sorry, no smokers or pets.

Very secure apartment with independent access from gated stairway in unique Telegraph Hill building on east hillside facing Treasure Island and the Bay Bridge with a deck facing downtown with water views too.  Located on a remote cul de sac with privacy and parking on the street used almost entirely by residents because so isolated.  The building is surrounded mainly by open space with only one home as a neighbor.  The apartment is down two levels from the street.  So much privacy that no window coverings are needed.  All utilities except electricity and free laundry included.  The one bedroom will accommodate a king size bed and has a built in wall of closet. The bathroom has a new shower and basin.  Kitchen is fully equipped and has a view of the Bay.  The combined living-dining room has downtown views, reflected view of the Bay and direct access to the deck, as well as built in cabinets. Fully wired by Comcast.
All hardwood floors except bath and kitchen. Rent controlled and no smoking building. Pets ok at $50/month. Laundry has 2 washers and 2 dryers and requires no payment. The building has NO parking.  Street parking is convenient, however, because street is isolated and used almost entirely by residents of the building; if assured garage parking is desired, there are nearby alternatives for rental in other buildings.",2025-12-03 00:47:33,116675.28,1370,2842

FURNISHED monthly rental
Beautiful victorian home in one of the best SF neighborhoods.  Quiet street with excellent access to restaurants/bars, local park, and buses. 2 bedrooms with Queen beds. You can park a SMALL car in the driveway but may need to move it from time to time so that we can access the garage! You'll have a washer and dryer in the house.
Step into this charming single-family home offering 2 cozy bedrooms and 1 well-placed bathroom. As you enter through the front door, you're welcomed into a warm and inviting living room that flows seamlessly into the dining area — perfect for everyday meals or casual entertaining.
Just beyond the dining room, you’ll find a functional kitchen, with the bathroom conveniently located just off to the side. The two bedrooms sit next to each other, thoughtfully separated by spacious closets for added privacy and storage.
Laundry is located just off the kitchen, making household chores a breeze. The kitchen has everything you need for a full meal or just a cup of coffee. Large six burner gas stove, full size refrigerator, large double sink, dishwasher, microwave, coffee maker and electric kettle are all available.
This is a free standing home, not an apartment so there is no one above or below you. The owner uses the garage so you might see or hear him outside, but he never enters the property and has a separate entrance to the garage.
Guests are required to sign a lease.
Home available only furnished, minimum stay is 30 nights. Perfect for those needing temporary housing while in SF.
One SMALL parking space is provided in the driveway. A small compact car will fit (think Honda Fit size). If your car sticks too far out into the size walk, City meter maids will ticket you. If this doesn't work, you may be able to park across the driveway if there is room, otherwise you can park on the street. Street parking is limited to 2 hours M-F 8am-6pm and they do issue tickets in the neighborhood.
Please do not block the sidewalk, as you will get a parking ticket.
Here are your options when getting around in San Francisco:
There are public transit options nearby. You can grab a bus at the corner of the block.
Uber/Lyft are incredibly fast, reliable, and cheap. You never have to worry about parking. You don't want to get a parking ticket (prices range from $70-$120).",2025-12-03 00:47:33,150343.21,7034,3692

**Pet Policy: Mission Bay by Windsor is a pet-friendly community that accepts up to two cats or dogs per home. There is a $500 pet deposit and a $75 monthly pet rent, per pet. Breed restrictions apply. NO Akitas, Alaskan Malamutes, Chows, Doberman Pinschers, German Shepherds, Mastiffs, Pit Bulls, Presa Canarios, Rottweilers, Shar Peis, Siberian Huskies, Staffordshire Terriers, Wolf Hybrids or any variation or mixes of these breeds.

**Garage Parking Info: Parking is $360/mo per vehicle. EV Parking: $385/mo
**SF City Street Parking: The city of San Francisco, unfortunately, does not recognize our address as an approved locale for residential parking permits. This is due, primarily, to the number of vehicles addressed to our community and the fact that we offer parking in the community. In addition, the city is not currently offering street permits to many of the newer multi-family housing developments within proximity to the new Chase Center and Oracle Park.

Owner occupied for the past 14 years.
I have loved living here and have seen this neighborhood grow into a vibrant community. The service., people, and amenities in this building are unmatched. I love waking up and being able to drag myself down to the gym for a quick workout or sauna. I love not having to own a printer because I can go down to the business center. When I'm feeling too lazy to make my own coffee, I love being able to pop over to St. Frank's, Philz, Blue Bottle, or Bluestone... so many amazing places nearby. The Ferry Building is just three (long) blocks away, and it is so lively here during baseball season, which is always fun. Sunrise runs are my favourite because you can see it rise behind the Bay Bridge. Public transit - Muni, BART, Transbay Terminal - are all 1-10 min away. Caltrain is a 20 minute walk.
I will miss this place a lot, but it's time for a change! Would love to find a long term tenant who will love this apartment as much as I have.

Spacious 1BD with Remodeled Kitchen and Lots of Natural Light in Inner Richmond
156 9th Avenue - 101, San Francisco, CA, 94118
$3495 per month
Available November 25th
1 bed, 1 full bath
797 sq. ft.
Deposit $3495.0
THE APARTMENT:
This spacious unit offers a warm and inviting atmosphere with hardwood flooring throughout the living areas and a sleek, tiled bathroom. Large windows fill the space with abundant natural light and provide excellent ventilation, creating a bright and airy environment. The kitchen is equipped with rich dark-wood cabinetry and crisp white appliances—including a dishwasher—making meal prep and cleanup both stylish and convenient. Perfect for comfortable living in a well-appointed home.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD: THE INNER RICHMOND
The Inner Richmond offers a great compromise of the urban and suburban -- it has both the energy of pedestrians, shops, cafes, and Irish bars as well as quiet nights, a low crime rate, and plenty of good schools. And then there’s the Presidio to the north and Golden Gate Park to the south. Inner Richmond borders the half of the park with the most things to see and do (other than nature): the Conservatory of Flowers, de Young Museum, the California Academy of Sciences, the Japanese Tea Garden, and the Botanical Gardens. Like any neighborhood in the western part of the city, though, be prepared for wind and fog, but also a relatively lower cost of living.

This isn’t just Unit 901 – it’s your Front-Row Seat to San Francisco’s most Jaw-Dropping Show. From your own Private Corner-Unit Balcony, watch the sun rise over the Bay Bridge, glide past Alcatraz at golden hour, and catch Marin County glowing at sunset. It’s the kind of view that makes your friends invent excuses to “drop by.”
Inside, Life’s Easy: Two Spacious Bedrooms, both with En-Suite Baths (because who wants to share?), In-Unit Laundry, Smart TV, High-Speed Internet, Cable TV, and all Utilities Included. Just bring your suitcase and your sense of adventure.
The Building? Covered. 24/7 Doorman for peace of mind, Secure Parking for your car, a Meditation Garden for your Zen moments, and a Residents’ Meeting Hall for gatherings. There’s even a Circular Driveway – because San Francisco traffic is wild enough without parallel parking stress.
The Neighborhood? Legendary. Ghirardelli Square is your next-door neighbor (chocolate emergencies = solved). Fort Mason, Marina Green, and the Presidio are steps away. Craving seafood at Fisherman’s Wharf, a Giants game at Oracle Park, or a Chase Center concert? Easy. Cable Cars and Ferries are practically at your doorstep.
This isn’t Just a Home – it’s a Lifestyle. A Glamorous, Waterfront, Pinch-Me kind of Lifestyle with a Splash of San Francisco Magic!
